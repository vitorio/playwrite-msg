# playwrite-msg

[t0mg's experimental word processor](https://github.com/t0mg/playwrite) for [Playdate](https://play.date), modified to support the new features in [Playdate OS 2.4](https://devforum.play.date/t/sdk-os-2-4-0-is-now-available/16286)+: the new `msg` command instead of the crank encoder, and saving/loading to the new top level `/Shared` folder.  Intended for use with custom firmware for the [Solder Party BBQ20KBD](https://bbq20kbd.solder.party/).
